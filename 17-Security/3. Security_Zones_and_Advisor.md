# Day 17: OCI Security Zones and Security Advisor

This lesson covers two proactive security services in OCI designed to enforce security best practices from the ground up.

### OCI Security Zones
A Security Zone is a feature that associates a compartment with a "Security Zone Recipe," which is a collection of mandatory security policies that cannot be bypassed.

#### Core Principle: Proactive Prevention
While a service like Cloud Guard is **reactive** (it detects and remediates misconfigurations after they occur), Security Zones are **proactive**. They prevent policy violations from occurring in the first place by denying the insecure action.

-   **How it works:** When a user tries to create or modify a resource in a Security Zone, OCI validates the action against the policies in the zone's recipe. If the action violates any policy, the operation is denied.
-   **Example Policies in a Recipe:**
    -   Buckets cannot be made public.
    -   Subnets in a VCN must be private.
    -   Customer-managed keys must be used for all data encryption.
    -   Compute instances cannot have public IP addresses.
-   **Use Case:** Ideal for compartments that host your most critical workloads, where security configuration must be strictly enforced.

### OCI Security Advisor
Security Advisor is a service that acts as a centralized dashboard and "wizard" for improving your security posture.

#### Functionality
-   **Unified View:** It aggregates findings from other security services like Cloud Guard and incorporates the best practices defined in Security Zones.
-   **Recommendations:** It analyzes your tenancy and provides tailored recommendations to strengthen your security.
-   **Guided Remediation:** It offers step-by-step guidance and workflows to help users implement these recommendations. For example, it can guide you through the process of creating a new, secure bucket inside a Security Zone.
-   **Goal:** To simplify and guide users towards achieving a stronger, more robust security posture in OCI.
