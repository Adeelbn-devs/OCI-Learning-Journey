# Day 17: Encryption Basics

This lesson covers the fundamental concepts of cryptography as they apply to cloud security.

### What is Encryption?
-   **Encryption:** The process of transforming readable data (**Plain Text**) into an unreadable format (**Cipher Text**).
-   **Decryption:** The reverse process of transforming Cipher Text back into Plain Text.
-   **Key:** A piece of information (a string of numbers/letters) that, when used with a cryptographic algorithm, can encrypt or decrypt data.

### Types of Data Encryption
1.  **Encryption at Rest:** Securing data that is stored on a physical medium, such as a Block Volume, Object Storage bucket, or database. This protects the data even if an attacker physically steals the storage hardware.
2.  **Encryption in Transit:** Securing data while it is moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or a private network. This is commonly achieved using protocols like TLS (which powers HTTPS).

### Encryption Methods
1.  **Symmetric Encryption:**
    -   Uses a **single, shared key** for both encryption and decryption.
    -   **Algorithm Example:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
    -   **Pros:** Very fast and efficient.
    -   **Cons:** The main challenge is the secure distribution and management of the shared key.

2.  **Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography):**
    -   Uses a mathematically linked **key pair**: a public key and a private key.
    -   **Public Key:** Can be shared with anyone. It is used to **encrypt** data.
    -   **Private Key:** Must be kept secret by the owner. It is used to **decrypt** data.
    -   **Workflow:** Anyone can encrypt a message for you using your public key, but only you can decrypt and read it using your private key.
    -   **Algorithm Example:** RSA.

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
-   **Definition:** A physical computing device specifically designed to safeguard and manage digital keys and perform cryptographic operations.
-   **Key Features:** HSMs are **tamper-resistant**. If physical tampering is detected, they are designed to erase the keys they hold to prevent compromise.
-   **Certification:** They are typically certified to high security standards, such as **FIPS 140-2**.
-   **OCI Context:** The **OCI Vault** service is built on FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3 certified HSMs, providing a highly secure environment for managing encryption keys.
