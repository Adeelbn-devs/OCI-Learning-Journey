# Day 17: Demo - OCI Security Zones

This lesson provides a hands-on demonstration of how to create a Security Zone and test its proactive policy enforcement capabilities.

### Demo Goal
The objective is to enable a Security Zone on an existing compartment and then verify that it prevents the creation of a non-compliant resource.

### Step 1: Prerequisite - Enable Cloud Guard
-   Security Zones rely on Cloud Guard as an underlying service. Before creating a Security Zone, Cloud Guard must be enabled for the tenancy.
-   The demo shows the guided workflow from the Security Zones page:
    1.  Click "Enable Cloud Guard".
    2.  The wizard prompts you to create the necessary IAM policies.
    3.  Select a reporting region and the target compartments to monitor (the demo selects the root compartment to monitor everything).
    4.  Enable Cloud Guard.

### Step 2: Creating a Security Zone
1.  Navigate back to **Identity & Security -> Security Zones**.
2.  Click **Create Security Zone**.
3.  The process involves associating an existing compartment with a security policy set called a "Recipe".
    -   **Select Compartment:** Choose the compartment you want to secure (e.g., `sandbox`).
    -   **Select Recipe:** Choose the set of policies. The demo uses the pre-defined `Oracle Managed Security Zone Recipe`.
4.  Click **Create**. The selected compartment is now a Security Zone.

### Step 3: Testing Policy Enforcement
1.  **The Policy:** The demo highlights a specific policy from the Oracle Managed Recipe: "Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with a customer-managed key from a Vault."
2.  **The Test Action:** The user navigates to Object Storage and attempts to create a new bucket inside the `sandbox` Security Zone. They leave the encryption setting on the default option, "Encrypt using Oracle-managed keys," which violates the policy.
3.  **The Result:** Upon clicking "Create," the operation is **denied**. OCI returns a clear error message stating that the action is forbidden by a Security Zone policy and specifies which policy was violated. This demonstrates the proactive prevention capability of Security Zones.
