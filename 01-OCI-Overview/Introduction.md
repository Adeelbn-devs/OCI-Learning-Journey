# Day 1: OCI Overview - The 7 Categories

This lesson provided a high-level overview of all the services OCI offers, broken down into 7 main categories.

### Key Pillars of OCI
The foundation of OCI is built on three core primitives:
- **Compute:** The brain of the cloud for running applications (VMs, Bare Metal, Containers).
- **Storage:** The store room for data (Object, File, Block Storage).
- **Networking:** The roads and security that connect everything.

### The 7 Categories
1.  **Core Infrastructure:** Compute, Storage, Networking.
2.  **Database Services:** Includes the famous Autonomous Database and open-source DBs like MySQL.
3.  **Data and AI:** For big data processing and machine learning.
4.  **Governance and Administration:** For managing and securing the cloud account. A key feature here is **Compartments** for organizing resources.
5.  **Developer Services:** Tools for developers, like APEX for low-code apps.
6.  **Analytics:** Services to analyze data and get business insights.
7.  **Application Services:** For building modern serverless applications.
