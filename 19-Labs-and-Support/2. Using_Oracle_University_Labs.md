# Day 19: Using the Oracle University (OU) Lab Environment

This lesson demonstrates how to access and work within a provisioned, paid OU lab environment. This is an alternative to using a personal OCI Free Tier account.

### Overview of the OU Lab Environment
-   The OU tenancy is a shared environment where each student is assigned their own private and isolated **Compartment**.
-   This compartment is pre-configured with the specific IAM policies and resource quotas required for the course's lab exercises.
-   The environment is temporary and is automatically deleted after a set period.

### Accessing and Using the Lab

1.  **Get Credentials:** After the lab has been requested and provisioned, all necessary information appears in the **"Lab" tab** of the course on `mylearn.oracle.com`. This includes:
    -   OCI Console URL
    -   Username
    -   A temporary Password

2.  **First Login:** The user must change their password upon the first login to the OCI console.

3.  **Find Instructions:** The step-by-step lab instructions are located in the **Activity Guide (PDF)**, which can be found under the "Guides" or "Playlist" tab in the course.

4.  **Verify Your Environment:** Before starting any lab steps, you must check the "Lab" tab for two critical pieces of information:
    -   The name of your **assigned Compartment**.
    -   The correct **Region** to work in (e.g., `us-ashburn-1`).

5.  **Perform the Lab:** Follow the instructions from the Activity Guide, ensuring that you have selected your assigned compartment in the OCI Console before creating any resources.

### Lab Environment Lifecycle
-   OU labs are temporary and are typically available for a limited time (e.g., 3 days).
-   After this period, the user credentials expire, and all resources created by the user are automatically deleted.
-   An extension can be requested if more time is needed.
