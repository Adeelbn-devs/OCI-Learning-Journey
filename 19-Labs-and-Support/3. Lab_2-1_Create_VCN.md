# Day 19: Lab 2-1 - Create and Configure a Virtual Cloud Network

This is the first hands-on lab based on the official Oracle University Activity Guide. The objective is to use the VCN Wizard to create a VCN with public and private subnets and the necessary gateways for internet connectivity.

### Prerequisites
-   Access to an OCI tenancy (e.g., the Free Tier account).
-   An assigned compartment to work in.

### Summary of Lab Steps

1.  **Log in** to the OCI Console.
2.  **Verify the Region:** Ensure the correct region is selected in the top-right corner of the console (**US East - Ashburn** for this lab).
3.  **Navigate to VCNs:** Go to the main menu -> **Networking -> Virtual Cloud Networks**.
4.  **Select Compartment:** From the "List Scope" on the left, select your assigned working compartment.

    -   **Compartment:** Ensure your assigned compartment is still selected.
8.  **Review and Create:** Accept the default CIDR blocks and review the list of resources the wizard will create (VCN, Subnets, IGW, NAT GW, SGW, Route Tables, Security Lists).
