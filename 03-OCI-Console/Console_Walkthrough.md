# Day 3: OCI Console Walkthrough

The OCI Console is the primary web-based interface for managing and monitoring all Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. It serves as the main control panel for your entire cloud environment.

The console can be accessed via the URL: `cloud.oracle.com`

## Key Features of the OCI Console

### 1. Main Navigation (Hamburger Menu ‚ò∞)
Located in the top-left corner, this menu is the main entry point to all OCI services. Services are logically grouped into categories like:
-   Compute
-   Storage
-   Networking
-   Database
-   Identity & Security
-   Developer Services

### 2. Region Selector üåç
Found in the top-right of the navigation bar, this menu allows you to view and switch between the geographical regions you are subscribed to. Any resources you create will be launched in the currently selected region.

### 3. Search Bar üîç
A powerful global search bar at the top of the console that helps you find:
-   Your own created resources (like compute instances, VCNs).
-   Links to OCI service pages.
-   Official Documentation.
-   Marketplace applications.

### 4. Developer Tools ‚ú®
These are two extremely useful tools built directly into the console for developers:

#### **Cloud Shell (>_)**
-   A free, browser-based Linux terminal (Bash shell).
-   It comes pre-configured with essential tools like the **OCI CLI, Git, Python, Java, and more.**
-   **Main Benefit:** It eliminates the need for any local setup or installation. You can manage your infrastructure using commands directly from your browser.

#### **Code Editor**
-   A rich, in-browser code editor similar to VS Code.
-   **Main Benefit:** Allows you to edit code, update scripts (like Terraform or Functions), and manage service workflows without switching between the console and a local development environment.

### 5. Helper Icons (Top-Right Corner)
-   **Announcements (üì¢):** Keeps you updated on new service launches, features, and scheduled maintenance.
-   **Help (?):** Provides access to the Support Center, where you can create support tickets, request service limit increases, and use the **Live Chat Assistant**.
-   **Language (üåê):** Allows you to change the display language of the console.

### 6. Health Dashboard
This section provides a real-time status of all OCI services across every region. It's the first place to check if you suspect a service is experiencing an outage or degradation.
