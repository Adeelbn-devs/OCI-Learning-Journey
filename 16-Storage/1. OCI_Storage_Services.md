# Day 16: OCI Storage Services Overview

OCI provides a variety of storage services, each designed for different workloads and requirements. Choosing the right storage is a critical architectural decision.

### 1. Local NVMe Storage
-   **Description:** High-performance, locally attached NVMe SSDs. The storage is physically inside the compute host.
-   **Persistence:** **Non-persistent (ephemeral)**. The data stored on these drives is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or if the underlying hardware fails.
-   **Performance:** Offers the highest possible IOPS and lowest latency, ideal for performance-intensive applications.
-   **Use Case:** Big data workloads, high-performance computing (HPC), databases requiring a fast scratch disk (like for temporary tablespaces).

### 2. Block Volume
-   **Description:** A network-attached block storage device, analogous to a virtual hard drive that you attach to your instance.
-   **Persistence:** **Persistent.** The volume's lifecycle is independent of the instance's lifecycle. Data remains intact even after the instance is terminated.
-   **Access:** Can be attached to a **single compute instance** at a time.
-   **Use Case:** Boot volumes for instances (OS disk), databases, or any application that requires persistent block-level storage.

### 3. File Storage
-   **Description:** A fully managed, network-attached shared file system that uses the Network File System (NFS) protocol.
-   **Persistence:** **Persistent.**
-   **Access:** Can be mounted and accessed by **thousands of instances concurrently**.
-   **Use Case:** Shared storage for enterprise applications, home directories, microservices requiring a shared state, or big data analytics.

### 4. Object Storage
-   **Description:** A regional, internet-scale storage platform for large amounts of unstructured data. Data is stored as objects within containers called buckets.
-   **Persistence & Durability:** **Highly durable and persistent.** OCI automatically replicates objects across multiple fault domains to protect against data loss.
-   **Access:** Accessed via standard HTTP protocols (REST APIs) or SDKs from anywhere on the internet (with proper permissions).
-   **Use Case:** Ideal for backups and archives, log files, big data lakes, and storing static assets like images and videos for websites.
