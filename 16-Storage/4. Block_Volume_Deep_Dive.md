# Day 16: OCI Block Volume Deep Dive

The OCI Block Volume service provides high-performance, persistent, and durable network-attached storage for compute instances.

### Core Characteristics
-   **Persistent:** The data on a block volume exists independently of the compute instance's lifecycle. It remains available even after the instance it was attached to is terminated.
-   **Durable:** The Block Volume service stores multiple copies of the data within a single Availability Domain to protect against hardware failure.

### Block Volume Performance Tiers
OCI offers several performance tiers that can be selected when a volume is created to balance performance and cost.
-   **Lower Cost:** Optimized for large, sequential I/O workloads like streaming and data warehousing.
-   **Balanced:** A mix of performance and cost-effectiveness, suitable for most workloads, including boot volumes.
-   **Higher Performance:** For I/O-demanding workloads with a high number of transactions.
-   **Ultra High Performance (UHP):** For the most mission-critical and I/O-intensive workloads, such as large relational databases.

### Key Features of Block Volume
1.  **Auto-tune Performance:** A cost-saving feature where a detached volume's performance is automatically switched to the "Lower Cost" tier. When reattached, it reverts to its original performance setting.
2.  **Encryption:** All data on block volumes and backups is **encrypted by default**, both **at rest** and **in-transit** (between the instance and the storage infrastructure).
3.  **Shareable Volumes:** A volume can be configured to be attached to multiple instances simultaneously with read/write access. This is useful for clustered applications that require access to shared storage.
4.  **Online Resizing:** You can expand the size of a block volume while it is still attached to an instance and in use, with **no downtime**.
5.  **Cross-Region Replication:** Provides the ability to asynchronously replicate a block volume to another OCI region. This is primarily used for disaster recovery, migration, and business expansion.
6.  **Volume Groups:** Allows you to group multiple block volumes (even if attached to different instances) and manage them as a single unit. This is critical for creating **time-consistent, coordinated backups** of applications that span multiple volumes.
