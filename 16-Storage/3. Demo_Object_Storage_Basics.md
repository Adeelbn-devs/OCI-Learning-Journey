# Day 16: Demo - Using OCI Object Storage

This lesson provides a hands-on demonstration of how to create a bucket, upload an object, and securely share it using a Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR).

### Step 1: Creating a Bucket
1.  Navigate to **Storage -> Object Storage**.
2.  Click **Create Bucket**.
3.  Provide a **Bucket Name**.
4.  Select a **Default Storage Tier** (e.g., Standard). This tier is set at the bucket level and cannot be changed later.
5.  Keep the default encryption (Oracle Managed Keys).
6.  The bucket is created with **Private** visibility by default.

### Step 2: Uploading an Object
-   Click on the newly created bucket to enter it.
-   Click the **Upload** button, select a file from your local machine, and upload it.

### Step 3: Understanding Object Access Control
-   **Private (Default):** If you copy the object's URL and try to access it from a browser, you will receive an authorization error. This is the expected behavior for a private bucket.
-   **Public:** If you edit the bucket's visibility to "Public," the object's URL becomes accessible to anyone on the internet. The console will warn you that this is less secure.

### Step 4: Secure Sharing with Pre-Authenticated Requests (PARs)
A PAR is the recommended method for sharing specific objects from a private bucket securely.

1.  Ensure the bucket's visibility is set to **Private**.
2.  Find the object you wish to share and click its action menu (...).
3.  Select **Create Pre-authenticated Request**.
4.  Configure the PAR:
    -   **Target:** The specific object is pre-selected.
    -   **Access Type:** Permit reads, writes, or both.
    -   **Expiration Date:** Set a date and time when the link will automatically expire.
5.  Click **Create Pre-authenticated Request**.
6.  A unique URL containing a security token will be generated. **This URL is only shown once**, so it must be copied and stored securely.
7.  Anyone with this specific URL can now access the object until the PAR expires. The rest of the bucket remains private and secure.
