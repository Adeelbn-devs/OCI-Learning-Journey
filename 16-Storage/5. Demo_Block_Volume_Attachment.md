# Day 16: Demo - Creating and Attaching a Block Volume

This lesson provides a hands-on demonstration of creating a new OCI Block Volume and attaching it to a running compute instance.

### Demo Goal
The primary goal is to add persistent storage to an existing compute instance without any downtime.

### Step 1: Creating a Block Volume
1.  Navigate to **Storage -> Block Storage -> Block Volumes** in the OCI Console.
2.  Click **Create Block Volume**.
3.  Configure the new volume:
    -   **Name:** A descriptive name for the volume.
    -   **Compartment:** The compartment where the volume will reside.
    -   **Availability Domain (AD):** This is a critical setting. The volume must be created in the **same AD** as the compute instance it will be attached to.
    -   **Size and Performance:** Specify the volume size (e.g., 100 GB) and select a performance tier using the VPU (Volume Performance Units) slider.
4.  Click **Create Block Volume**. The volume will take a few moments to provision and will then be in the "Available" state.

### Step 2: Attaching the Volume to an Instance
1.  From the Block Volumes list, click on the newly created volume to view its details.
2.  In the "Attached Instances" section, click the **Attach to Instance** button.
3.  Configure the attachment:
    -   **Attachment Type:** Choose between `iSCSI` and `Paravirtualized`. The demo uses `paravirtualized`, which is a simple option for VMs.
    -   **Instance:** Select the target compute instance from the dropdown list. Only instances in the same AD will be shown.
4.  Click **Attach**. The volume's state will change to "Attaching" and then "Attached".

### Step 3: Verifying the Attachment inside the Instance
1.  Connect to the compute instance via SSH.
2.  Run the command `lsblk` to list the block devices visible to the operating system.
3.  The output will now show the newly attached volume (e.g., as a 100 GB device), in addition to the instance's original boot volume.

### Next Steps (Post-Attachment)
The demo notes that after attachment, the new block device must be partitioned, formatted with a file system (e.g., ext4, xfs), and mounted to a directory before it can be used to store files. These OS-level steps are not covered in the foundations demo.
