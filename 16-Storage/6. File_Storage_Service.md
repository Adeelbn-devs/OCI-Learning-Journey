# Day 16: OCI File Storage Service (FSS)

The OCI File Storage service (FSS) is a fully managed, elastic, and shared file system solution for the cloud. It provides a durable, scalable, and secure enterprise-grade network file system.

### Core Characteristics
-   **Shared Access:** This is the primary feature of FSS. It allows thousands of compute instances to access the same file system concurrently.
-   **Protocol:** FSS supports the industry-standard **Network File System version 3 (NFSv3)** protocol for connectivity.
-   **Managed Service:** As a managed service, OCI handles all the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and patching.
-   **Elasticity:** The storage capacity of the file system grows automatically as you add more data, and you only pay for the capacity you use.

### Key Use Cases
FSS is ideal for workloads that require a shared file system:
-   **Oracle Applications:** It is certified for use with enterprise applications like Oracle E-Business Suite.
-   **General Purpose File Sharing:** Can be used as a central repository for files, similar to a corporate Network Attached Storage (NAS) or a shared network drive.
-   **Lift and Shift:** Helps in migrating legacy applications that rely on a traditional file system structure to the cloud.
-   **Microservices & Containers:** Provides a persistent, shared state for stateless applications, allowing multiple containers to read and write to the same data store.
-   **Big Data & Analytics:** Storing large datasets that need to be accessed by multiple compute nodes for parallel processing.

### Data Protection and Security
-   **Snapshots:** FSS provides a snapshot capability, which creates point-in-time, read-only copies of the entire file system. These are used for backup and data protection.
-   **Encryption:** All data is encrypted by default, both **at rest** using AES-256 encryption and **in-transit** between the instances and the FSS service.
