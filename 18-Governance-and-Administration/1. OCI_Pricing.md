# Day 18: OCI Pricing and Cost Management

This lesson provides an overview of OCI's pricing philosophy, the different pricing models available, and key cost differentiators.

### OCI Pricing Philosophy
OCI's pricing is designed to be simple, transparent, and significantly lower than other major cloud providers.

### Pricing Models

1.  **Pay As You Go (PAYG):**
    -   The standard on-demand model.
    -   You pay only for the resources you use, with no upfront fees or long-term commitments.
    -   Usage is metered on a per-second or per-hour basis depending on the resource.
    -   Includes a "Consumption-based" model for services like Oracle Functions, where you are billed only for the execution time.

2.  **Annual Universal Credits:**
    -   A pre-payment model where an organization commits to a specific amount of cloud usage for a year.
    -   In return for the commitment, they receive a significant discount on the PAYG rates.
    -   Credits must be used within the 12-month period. Any overage is billed at the PAYG rate.

3.  **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):**
    -   Allows customers who already own on-premises Oracle software licenses (e.g., for Oracle Database) to use those licenses on OCI.
    -   This significantly reduces the cost of running those workloads in the cloud, as the customer only pays for the underlying infrastructure, not the software.

### Key Pricing Differentiators

1.  **Consistent Pricing Across All Regions:**
    -   Unlike other clouds where prices vary by region, OCI offers the **same price** for its services in all public regions globally.
    -   This simplifies cost estimation and eliminates the need to choose a region based on cost.

2.  **Data Transfer Costs:**
    -   **Data Ingress (Incoming):** Free for all services.
    -   **Data Transfer Between Availability Domains:** **Free**. OCI does not charge for data transfer between ADs within the same region. This encourages the use of highly available, multi-AD architectures without a cost penalty.
    -   **Data Egress (Outgoing):**
        -   The first 10TB of data transfer out to the internet each month is free.
        -   Beyond the free tier, the per-GB cost is significantly lower (up to 10x cheaper) than other major cloud providers, making OCI very cost-effective for data-heavy applications.
