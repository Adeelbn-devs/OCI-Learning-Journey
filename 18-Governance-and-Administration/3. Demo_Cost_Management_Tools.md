# Day 18: Demo - OCI Cost Management Tools

This lesson provides a hands-on walkthrough of the two primary tools used for tracking and analyzing costs in the OCI console: Cost Analysis and Budgets.

### Part 1: Using the Cost Analysis Tool
The Cost Analysis dashboard provides an interactive and visual way to understand cloud spending.

1.  **Navigation:** Go to **Billing & Cost Management -> Cost Analysis**.
2.  **Functionality:**
    -   By default, it shows the current month's spending, grouped by **Service**.
    -   **Date Filtering:** The time range of the report can be adjusted to view historical data.
    -   **Grouping:** The "Group by" dimension is a powerful feature that allows you to slice and dice cost data. The demo showcases grouping by:
        -   `Service`: To see which OCI service is incurring the most cost.
        -   `Region`: To identify spending in different geographical locations.
        -   `Compartment`: To track costs by project, environment, or department.
        -   `Tags`: To analyze costs based on custom metadata. For example, a `CreatedBy` tag can show spending per user.
    -   **Filtering:** Filters can be applied to drill down into the data (e.g., show costs for a specific region *and* a specific compartment).
    -   **Saving Reports:** A customized view with specific groupings and filters can be saved as a named report for quick access later.

### Part 2: Setting up a Budget
Budgets are used to proactively monitor spending against a defined threshold.

1.  **Navigation:** Go to **Billing & Cost Management -> Budgets**.
2.  **Creation Process:**
    -   Click **Create Budget**.
    -   **Define Scope:** The budget can be targeted at a specific **Compartment** or a **Cost-Tracking Tag**. The demo uses a compartment.
    -   **Set Amount:** Define the monthly budget amount (e.g., $100).
    -   **Create an Alert Rule:**
        -   Set a **Threshold** that will trigger the alert. This can be a percentage of the budget (e.g., 90%) or a fixed amount.
        -   The alert can be triggered based on **Actual Spend** or **Forecasted Spend**.
        -   Provide one or more **Email Addresses** to receive the notification.
