# Day 18: OCI Cost Management and Governance

OCI provides a suite of tools to help users track, analyze, and control their cloud spending.

### Tools for Tracking and Analysis

1.  **Budgets:**
    -   Budgets are used to set cost-tracking thresholds for specific compartments or the entire tenancy.
    -   You can create **Alerts** that trigger notifications when your actual spending or forecasted spending reaches a certain percentage of your budget. This helps in proactively monitoring costs and avoiding surprises.

2.  **Cost Analysis:**
    -   A built-in visualization tool in the OCI console that provides charts and graphs to help you understand your spending patterns.
    -   You can filter and group costs by various dimensions, such as by service, compartment, or tags, to identify which areas are contributing most to your bill.

3.  **Usage Reports:**
    -   Highly detailed and granular reports of resource consumption.
    -   These are generated daily as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files and stored in an OCI Object Storage bucket.
    -   They contain one record per resource per hour and are used for detailed accounting, financial analysis, and chargeback scenarios.

### Tools for Controlling Costs

1.  **Service Limits:**
    -   These are default limits placed on the quantity of resources that can be created in a tenancy.
    -   They serve as a safety measure to prevent fraud and accidental, excessive resource provisioning.
    -   Limits can be increased by filing a service request with Oracle Support.

2.  **Compartment Quotas:**
    -   A policy-based governance tool that allows you to set hard limits on resource creation within a specific compartment.
    -   While a budget will only *alert* you about overspending, a quota will actively *block* users from creating new resources if the quota limit has been reached.
    -   You can use quota policy statements to `set` a specific limit, `unset` a limit, or `zero` a limit (which completely prohibits the creation of a specific resource type in that compartment).
    -   This is a powerful tool for enforcing budgets and governance policies on different teams or environments.
