# Day 18: Demo - OCI Cloud Advisor

This lesson provides a hands-on walkthrough of the OCI Cloud Advisor service, which acts as a built-in consultant to help optimize your tenancy.

### What is OCI Cloud Advisor?
Cloud Advisor is a free, integrated OCI service that analyzes your cloud resource usage and provides actionable recommendations. The recommendations are categorized into four key areas.

### The Four Pillars of Recommendations

#### 1. Cost Management
-   **Goal:** To help you save money by identifying underutilized resources.
-   **Example Recommendations:**
    -   **Delete Idle Compute Instances:** Finds VMs that have low CPU utilization over a period of time.
    -   **Delete Unattached Block/Boot Volumes:** Finds storage volumes that are not attached to any instance but are still incurring costs.
-   **Action:** For these recommendations, Cloud Advisor provides an **"Implement"** button to delete the identified resource directly from the interface.

#### 2. Performance
-   **Goal:** To improve the performance of your resources by suggesting configuration optimizations.
-   **Example Recommendation:**
    -   **Enable Performance Autotuning on Block Volumes:** Identifies block volumes where the autotuning feature is disabled.
-   **Action:** This can also be fixed with the **"Implement"** button.

#### 3. High Availability
-   **Goal:** To improve the resilience and fault tolerance of your applications.
-   **Example Recommendation:**
    -   **Distribute Instances Across Fault Domains:** Warns you if multiple instances are clustered in a single fault domain, creating a single point of failure.
-   **Action:** This recommendation is informational and requires the user to manually re-distribute their instances.

#### 4. Security
-   **Goal:** To help you improve your security posture.
-   **Function:** This section of Cloud Advisor serves as a direct link to **Cloud Guard**. All security posture management, problem detection, and remediation is handled by Cloud Guard, which provides a more comprehensive set of security tools.
