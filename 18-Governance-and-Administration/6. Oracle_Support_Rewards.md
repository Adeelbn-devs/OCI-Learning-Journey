# Day 18: Oracle Support Rewards

The Oracle Support Rewards program is a unique value-add for Oracle's on-premises technology customers, designed to reduce their support costs as they adopt OCI.

### What is the Program?
It's a loyalty program where customers earn rewards from their OCI consumption. These rewards are then automatically applied to pay for their on-premises technology software update license and support bills.

### Eligibility
The program is for customers with Oracle technology software licenses who are also paying for an active support contract.

### How It Works

#### Earning Rewards
Rewards are earned based on the monthly OCI consumption. The earning rate depends on the customer's license agreement:
-   **Standard Customers:** Earn **$0.25** in rewards for every $1.00 of OCI consumption.
-   **Unlimited License Agreement (ULA) Customers:** Earn a higher rate of **$0.33** in rewards for every $1.00 of OCI consumption.

Almost all "Pay As You Go" and "Annual Universal Credit" OCI services are eligible for earning rewards.

#### Redeeming Rewards
-   The process is seamless and automatic.
-   The earned rewards are automatically applied as a form of payment towards the customer's next eligible on-premises technology support invoice.
-   The more a customer spends on OCI, the greater the savings on their support bill, potentially reducing it to zero.

### Tracking
Customers can view their earned, redeemed, and available Support Rewards directly in the OCI Console under the **Billing & Cost Management** section.
