# Day 15: Introduction to OKE (Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes)

This lesson covers the fundamentals of containers, the role of Kubernetes as an orchestrator, and how OCI provides this as a managed service through OKE.

### VMs vs. Containers
-   **Virtual Machine (VM):** A full virtualization of a physical machine, including its own guest operating system (OS). This makes them heavy (gigabytes in size) and slower to boot.
-   **Container:** A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes an application and its dependencies. Containers share the host machine's OS kernel, making them much smaller (megabytes in size) and faster to start (seconds vs. minutes for VMs).

### Container Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s)
While containers are easy to run individually, managing hundreds or thousands of them requires an orchestration system. Kubernetes is the industry-standard open-source system for this.
-   **It automates:**
    -   **Deployment:** Rolling out new versions of applications.
    -   **Scaling:** Automatically scaling containers up or down based on load.
    -   **Self-healing:** Replacing or restarting failed containers.
    -   **Networking:** Managing communication between containers.

### OKE: Oracle's Managed Kubernetes Service
OKE is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud.

#### OKE Architecture
-   **Control Plane (The Brain):**
    -   This is the core of Kubernetes, responsible for managing the state of the cluster, scheduling containers, and responding to events.
    -   In OKE, the Control Plane is **fully managed by Oracle at no extra cost**.
-   **Worker Nodes (The Brawn):**
    -   These are the compute instances (VMs or Bare Metal) where your application containers actually run.
    -   These are **managed and paid for by the customer**.
-   **Node Pool:** A group of worker nodes with the same configuration (shape, image, etc.).
-   **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A pod encapsulates one or more containers, storage resources, and a unique network IP.

#### OKE Cluster and Node Options
-   **Cluster Types:**
    -   **Enhanced Clusters:** Support all available features and have a financially-backed Service Level Agreement (SLA).
    -   **Basic Clusters:** Support only core features and come with a Service Level Objective (SLO), not an SLA.
-   **Node Types:**
    -   **Managed Nodes:** You are responsible for managing the nodes, including Kubernetes upgrades and capacity management. This offers more control and flexibility.
    -   **Virtual Nodes:** A **serverless** option where Oracle handles all node management tasks (patching, upgrades, scaling). This is a simpler, hands-off experience and is only available for Enhanced Clusters.
