# Day 15: Demo - Manually Creating a Compute Instance and VCN

This demo provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough of provisioning a public web server from scratch, creating all the necessary networking components manually.

### Part 1: Manual Network Configuration
This process demonstrates what the "VCN Wizard" automates behind the scenes.

1.  **Create VCN:** A base VCN is created with a specified name and CIDR block.
2.  **Create Public Subnet:** A public subnet is created within the VCN. It is associated with a default Route Table and a default Security List.
3.  **Create Internet Gateway (IGW):** An IGW is created to provide a path for internet traffic.
4.  **Configure Routing:** A **Route Rule** is added to the default Route Table.
    -   **Destination:** `0.0.0.0/0` (representing all internet traffic).
    -   **Target:** The newly created Internet Gateway.
5.  **Configure Firewall:** An **Ingress Rule** is added to the default Security List.
    -   **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0` (representing traffic from any IP address).
    -   **Destination Port:** `80` (the standard port for HTTP/web traffic).

### Part 2: Launching the Compute Instance
1.  Navigate to **Compute -> Instances** and click **Create Instance**.
2.  **Configuration:**
    -   Select a name, compartment, AD, and Fault Domain.
    -   Choose an **Image** (Operating System) and a **Shape** (Hardware).
    -   For **Networking**, select the manually created VCN and Public Subnet. Ensure the "Assign a public IPv4 address" option is enabled.
3.  **SSH Access:** The public key of an SSH key pair is pasted into the instance configuration. This will be used to authenticate when connecting to the instance.

### Part 3: Connecting to and Configuring the Instance
1.  Once the instance is in the "Running" state, its **Public IP Address** is copied.
2.  Using a terminal (like OCI Cloud Shell), connect to the instance via SSH:
    ```bash
    ssh -i <path_to_private_key> opc@<instance_public_ip>
    ```
3.  **Software Installation:** Once connected, commands are run to:
    -   Install the Apache web server (`httpd`).
    -   Start the `httpd` service.
    -   Open the instance's internal firewall for port 80.
    -   Create a simple `index.html` file.

### Part 4: Testing
The setup is verified by pasting the instance's Public IP Address into a web browser, which successfully displays the newly created webpage.
