# Day 15: OCI Compute Scaling

Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application to meet changing demands. OCI provides two main methods for scaling.

### 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up / Scale Down)
Vertical scaling involves changing the shape (number of CPUs, amount of RAM) of an existing compute instance.

-   **Process:** To scale vertically, you typically stop the instance, change its shape to a larger or smaller one, and then restart it.
-   **Key Consideration:** This method requires **downtime** as the instance needs to be rebooted.
-   **Use Case:** Suitable for applications with predictable growth where a short, scheduled downtime is acceptable.

### 2. Horizontal Scaling (Autoscaling - Scale Out / Scale In)
Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to or removing instances from a pool of servers. OCI's **Autoscaling** feature automates this process.

-   **Key Benefits:**
    -   **High Availability:** If one instance fails, traffic is redirected to the other healthy instances in the pool.
    -   **Elasticity:** Automatically adjusts the number of running instances to match the current traffic demand, which is highly cost-effective.
    -   **No Downtime:** Scaling events happen without interrupting the application.

### How OCI Autoscaling Works: The 3 Components

Autoscaling is configured using three main components that work together:

1.  **Instance Configuration:**
    -   A **template** that defines the properties of the instances to be created.
    -   It includes details like the OS image, shape, VCN/subnet, storage, and metadata.

2.  **Instance Pool:**
    -   A **group of instances** that are all created from the same Instance Configuration.
    -   The pool manages the instances as a single logical unit. You can start, stop, or terminate all instances in the pool at once.
    -   For high availability, the pool can be configured to distribute instances across different Availability Domains and Fault Domains.

3.  **Autoscaling Configuration:**
    -   This is the "brain" that is attached to an Instance Pool and contains the logic for scaling.
    -   It consists of:
        -   **Pool Size:** The initial, minimum, and maximum number of instances the pool can have.
        -   **Scaling Policy:** A rule based on a performance metric. The policy continuously monitors a metric (like CPU or Memory utilization) and triggers a scaling event when a defined threshold is crossed.
            -   **Scale-Out Rule (Adding instances):** e.g., `IF CPU utilization > 70% for 5 minutes, THEN add 2 more instances.`
            -   **Scale-In Rule (Removing instances):** e.g., `IF CPU utilization < 20% for 10 minutes, THEN remove 1 instance.`
